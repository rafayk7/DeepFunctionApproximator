The early acquisition of strong mathematical skills is an important predictor of future academic and employment success. However, since the establishment of the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), Canadian students’ math performance has shown a consistent decline. The quality of a student’s home learning environment is also crucial to academic success. However, not all parents or caregivers can contribute to their child’s education. As such, there is a need for tools to enhance math teaching and learning. To address this, math technologies have emerged as a promising solution to aid in developing both basic and advanced mathematical skills and proficiencies. 

One such example is PhotoMath, a free app that uses a mobile camera to scan and solve mathematical equations. It leverages a neural network to identify the formula in the input image, and a problem-solving algorithm to output the solution. The app has been shown to enhance the algebraic learning of students and receives positive reviews from teachers. Though PhotoMath covers various math concepts like arithmetic operations, linear equations, systems of equations, complex numbers, matrices, and calculus, it lacks the equally important capability of predicting polynomial equations based on graphical input. This project aims to fill this gap by designing a neural network that can accurately predict polynomial equations solely based on graphical representations.
